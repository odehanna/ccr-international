            A SERVICE ORGANOZATION
         </h1>

        <p>The Human Resources department of a large service organization was experiencing
        	a serious breakdown in communication - little work was being accomplished,
        	information was intentionally being withheld, and absenteeism was significant.
        	While the organization felt that most of the employees in the department
        	were being childish, they also recognized that the situation was continuing
        	to worsen and needed to be addressed.</p>

        	<p>CCR International began with a Conflict Diagnostic, talking to all employees
        		in the department in order to understand what the issues were and why they had escalated.
        		Conflicts between individuals were identified. CCR International provided Mediation Services
        		that allowed these individuals to discuss their differences and find constructive solutions.
        		CCR International also identified several individuals in the team who had intensified the
        		conflict due to their communication styles and behavior. With sensitivity and compassion,
        		CCR International coaches helped these individuals gain skills and tools for working with
        		others in a more positive and productive manner.</p>

          <p>As the team started to establish new communication patterns, CCR International facilitated
              a team session for the entire department. During this session, the staff looked to the future
              and made a commitment to ongoing improvements in their interactions.</p>

          <p>The organization saw an immediate change in the department. Sick days went down, turnover decreased,
            and productivity was enhanced.</p>

            A SECURITY COMPANY
         </h1>

        <p>A disgruntled employee claimed that his manager had discriminated against him
          in a recent promotion process. The company wanted to resolve the situation without
          losing either a valued employee or a long-standing manager.</p>

          <p>CCR International began with a formal Investigation into the employee's claims of discrimination.
            As CCR International examined the facts, it became clear that this was not a case of discrimination.
            It was, however, a situation in which communication and trust between employee and manger had broken
             down.</p>

          <p>Upon completion of our Investigation, CCR International recommended Mediation as an appropriate way
            to address the issues.</p>

          <p>The two individuals went through the Mediation process. This allowed them to clarify numerous misunderstandings,
            articulate expectations, and develop a working plan for the future.</p>

          <p>Both parties expressed appreciation for a process that assisted them in establishing a positive working relationship. The company was grateful that two valuable staff
            members were once again focused and contributing to the success of the organization.</p>

            A  GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT
         </h1>

        <p>A large Government Department had recently restructured and was surprised by the decline in employee morale and evident presenteeism.
          They wanted to know why employees were so negative about the new structure and what they could do to resolve
          the situation.</p>

          <p>CCR International began with an Organizational Assessment. Employees were able to air their concerns and issues via surveys, interviews, and focus groups.
            Through this process, CCR International identified areas where the new structure was
            causing confusion and inefficiency. The Organizational Assessment also brought to light
            several issues that were unrelated to the restructuring itself, but were exacerbated by
            the change that everyone was experiencing.</p>

          <p>CCR International presented the findings of the Organizational Assessment to the entire department and led teams through a facilitated planning process.
            These teams worked at a comprehensive integration of the structure so that inefficiencies and
            inconsistencies were eliminated. With CCR International's assistance, the organization also
            developed an internal communication plan to assist in bringing issues to the attention of
            leadership so that they could be addressed immediately.</p>

            LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY
         </h1>

        <p>A Law Enforcement Agency was concerned that, after the introduction of policies regarding diversity and harassment in the workplace,
          the number of complaints of harassment and discrimination remained unchanged.</p>

          <p>CCR International began by developing a training program for all supervisors within the organization. The objective of this training program was
            to give participants practical skills and tools to address issues and conflicts in the workplace.</p>

          <p>By providing supervisors with these skills, many potential conflicts were prevented and communication was enhanced. Conflicts that could have
            resulted in harassment situations were resolved before they seriously escalated.</p>

          <p>Following this organization-wide training program, CCR International provided Consultation Services, advising the organization as they restructured their internal
            processes for managing harassment, discrimination, and other complaints. The organization built greater internal
            capacity for addressing these situations quickly, using collaborative processes for resolution and
            enhancing employee satisfaction.</p>
