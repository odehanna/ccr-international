        <p>Our experience speaks for itself.
        	The following are real-life examples of situations where CCR International
        	has been called in to help. Minor details have been changed
        	to ensure the confidentiality of our clients.</p>

        A SERVICE ORGANOZATION
      </h1>

        <p>The Human Resources department of a large service organization was experiencing
        	a serious breakdown in communication - little work was being accomplished,
        	information was intentionally being withheld, and absenteeism was significant.
        	While the organization felt that most of the employees in the department
        	were being childish, they also recognized that the situation was continuing
        	to worsen and needed to be addressed.</p>

        	<p>CCR International began with a Conflict Diagnostic, talking to all employees
        		in the department in order to understand what the issues were and why they had escalated.
        		Conflicts between individuals were identified. CCR International provided Mediation Services
        		that allowed these individuals to discuss their differences and find constructive solutions.
        		CCR International also identified several individuals in the team who had intensified the
        		conflict due to their communication styles and behavior. With sensitivity and compassion,
        		CCR International coaches helped these individuals gain skills and tools for working with
        		others in a more positive and productive manner.</p>
