  <p class="paragraph">Conflict Can Be a Positive Force in Your Organization.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Conflict, simply put, is a difference or gap. It can be a difference of wants, needs, or expectations. A gap between perceptions and intentions, intended outcomes and actual outcomes.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In its best forms, conflict is a catalyst for dialogue and creativity. Successful companies know this and learn to manage these gaps effectively, turning conflict into an opportunity for growth and change. </p>

<p class="paragraph">For over 20 years Centre for Conflict Resolution International has been partnering with organizations to bridge the gap between chaotic, destructive conflict and engaging, creative functionality. </p>

<p class="paragraph">We have developed and utilize a variety of tools, processes and resources that allow people and organizations to resolve issues that are negatively impacting them and to restore “functional harmony” in the workplace.  </p>

<p class="paragraph">Please explore our website to find out more about us and how we can help. Or contact us by phone or email to begin the conversation.</p>
