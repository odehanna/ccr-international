  <p class="paragraph">CCR International assists organizations in managing difficult issues,
   resolving conflicts, and preventing dispute escalation. We are called in when
   assumptions are running rampant, people are angry and stressed, structures and systems
   are ineffective, and organizations are unable to attain or maintain their business objectives.</p>

     <p class="paragraph">Finding solutions that work so people can get back to work. That's what CCR International is all about.

    CCR International was established in 1993 with the vision of bringing together the best practices of alternative dispute resolution
    and organizational development to offer services that would enhance organizational effectiveness.

    With our team of professional negotiators, arbitrators, mediators, investigators, coaches,
    trainers, conflict resolution practitioners, and organizational development specialists,
    we have established a reputation for knowledgeable, responsive and results-oriented service.</p>
