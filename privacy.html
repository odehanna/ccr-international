         <ul class="bullet">

          <li>Demographic information</li>
          <li>Your interests and preferences</li>
          <li>Transactional information (such as the history of your purchases or the fact that your name and address was obtained by us on a contest entry)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may use the information in these ways:</p>

        <p>To provide the product, information or service you requested </p>

        <p>If you are a customer, we need your name and address (postal and/or email) in order to deliver the product, information or service you requested and to follow up with you about the transaction (i.e., send a bill). We may also send you further information about the product or services, its offers, or other products produced under its name.</p>

        <p>To send you information about products, information or services </p>

        <p>From time-to-time we make our list of customers available to other carefully screened organizations that want to let you know about a product or service that might interest you. The material to be sent to you is reviewed by us before the names and addresses are released to ensure the company is reputable and their materials are appropriate and not misleading. If you would prefer for us NOT to share your information, simply inform us (see "Contact Us" below). </p>

        <p>Your credit card number is used only for processing payments and for presenting you with payment options - not for marketing purposes. </p>

          <li>Browser information (i.e. the URL of the web page you were just on, the IP address of the computer you are using, your domain type, and your browser version). Browser information is automatically recorded as part of transmitting information over the Internet. We may use it to help us display information in the best format for you.</li>
          <li>Cookies. Some of our sites may use cookies. A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser's files for our reference. No one else can read this file.

          <li>Advertising Reports. We may develop summary reports for advertisers, to help them better understand our audience and provide advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you.

        <p>E-mail communications will always include an identification of the sender and an "Unsubscribe" option.</p>

        <p>If you receive a mailing from CCR International and you wish to know the source of your name (i.e. what list it came from), we will make every reasonable effort to determine the source and provide you with the information. For this request, or to confirm that any personal information we may have is correct, please contact us.</p>

        <p><b>Security</b></p>

        <p>We make every reasonable effort to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Our security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.</p>

        <p>Only authorized individuals and suppliers have access to customer information. Where information is sent to a third party for processing, we make sure, through our contracts with them, that all customer information is kept secure. We keep your information for the time we are providing you with a product or service, and for a reasonable time thereafter in the event that you wish to resume service.</p>

        <p>We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Credit card information is processed using industry-standard encryption and security. We do not collect personal information from bulletin boards or forums. However, we cannot guarantee that personal information voluntarily disclosed on message boards and discussion groups will not be collected and used by others, which may result in unsolicited messages to you from other parties.</p>
