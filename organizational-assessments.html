        <p>CCR International's Organizational Assessments provide
          an accurate picture of the climate, challenges, and opportunities that
          your organization faces. Given a clear and unbiased view of the organization
          from all levels, you will be positioned to initiate effective change,
          implement appropriate resolution processes, and maintain a positive and
          productive organizational culture.</p>

          of an Organizational Assessment will depend on the size
          of your organization, available resources, time constraints,
          and your purpose or desired outcome for the Assessment.
