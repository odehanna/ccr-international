        <p>The Core Leadership Program does not <strong>teach</strong> you to be a leader. Rather, it provides you with the <em>expertise, opportunity</em> and <em>support</em> so that you can <em>learn to become</em> a great leader.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Core Leadership Program</strong> is designed to help move <em>good</em> leaders to <em>great</em> leaders and <em>potential</em> leaders to <em>practiced</em> leaders. Consisting of a combination of in-class sessions, online discussions, group and individual coaching over a period of 3-6 months, the program takes an innovative approach to the organizational challenges and complex issues that workplaces are currently facing. That’s because we understand that leadership is at the core of organizational innovation, stability and adaptability. Through a combination of theory, reflection, and practice the program offers an opportunity to increase self-awareness, enhance knowledge, and build skills needed in leadership and the human interactions required in the leadership role. If there were ever a time for leaders and emerging leaders to invest in becoming <em>great</em> leaders, now’s the time!</p>
