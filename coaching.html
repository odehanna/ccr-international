        <p>Coaching is a self-reflective, focused and meaningful conversation. Coaching allows the individual to explore the assumptions, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that are getting in the way of achieving his/her goals â€“ whether that is to be an effective leader, to resolve conflict, to work more effectively with others, or to live life in a positive and intentional way.</p>

        <p>CCR offers executive/leadership coaching, development coaching, as well as crisis or conflict just-in-time coaching.</p>
