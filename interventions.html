        <p>When conflict between individuals erupts it can impact productivity, morale, and teamwork. But for the individuals involved it may be extremely difficult to find their way out of the situation on their own. The assistance of a neutral third party will allow the involved individuals to talk together in a safe and controlled environment, focusing on the key issues, acknowledging points of agreement, and exploring opportunities for moving forward.</p>

        <p>CCRâ€™s conflict management practitioners manage the emotional climate allowing individuals to have the crucial conversations required to resolve conflicts. Whether the process is a formal mediation or informal problem-solving session, CCR can provide you with the intervention assistance you need.</p>
