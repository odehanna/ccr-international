        CONFLICT DIAGNOSTICS
      </h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Just like a physician will do a thorough examination and testing before
          recommending treatment, CCR International will analyze and assess all
          conflict situations before determining an appropriate resolution process.
          Diagnosing conflict in this way significantly increases the likelihood of
          a successful resolution and decreases the amount of time required to resolve the situation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">CCR International's experience has shown that the key to resolving conflict successfully
          is utilizing the appropriate conflict resolution process.
          CCR International has developed a Conflict Diagnostic method
          based on accepted conflict theory that determines the conflict
          resolution process best suited to the situation. This analysis
          takes into consideration the type of conflict, the individuals
          involved, the cause(s) of the conflict, the corporate culture
          and environment, and the goals and priorities of those involved,
          including the organization as a whole.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">The goals of a Conflict Diagnostic are:</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>To identify all individuals involved in and affected by the conflict so that resolution can be all-inclusive</li>
          <li>To identify all relevant issues (real and perceived) so that resolution can be complete</li>
          <li>To identify appropriate processes to address the situation so that resolution can be timely and cost-effective</li>
        </ul>
